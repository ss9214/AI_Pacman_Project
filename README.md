# AI_Pacman_Project
A Project for UMass Amherst's CS383 course that explores various fundamental techniques in Artificial Intelligence, such as Searching, Heuristics, and Reinforcement Learning.

There are 4 projects, each involving a different technique important in Artificial Intelligence. This project was adopted into the CS383 curriculum at UMass Amherst from the CS188 course at UC Berkeley.

Project 1: Search - DFS, BFS, UCS, Greedy Search, A* Search

Project 2: Heuristics - minimax, alpha-beta pruning, expectimax

Project 3: Reinforcement Learning - Value Iteration, Q-learning, Approximate Q-learning

Project 4: Behavior Modeling - Hidden Markov Model, Bayes Net, Particle Filtering.

This project was completed by myself and @algispetlin.
